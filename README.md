## Introduction

An in-game companion app for players and Discord bot for server administrators.

The application monitors and extracts data from any number of configured local ARK servers and exposes this data through a Web App, Web API and Discord Bot.

It aims to provide important functions to players: dino listings, food-status, breeding info, statistics; and server admins: rcon-commands, server managing etc. It does not enable cheating or making available data that have a considerable impact on how the game is played.
